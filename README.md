# Friend_Builder


# Project Description:
Android app to help people who have similar interests connect and chat: Use GPS to locate and match similar interests (alternatively, have the user set up the info themselves and allow them to read the descriptions of other users in the vicinity)


## MVP (Minimal Feature Set):


User account

User profile

Messaging between users

GPS based distance between users visible

Users create events for others to see

Users can hide from/ignore other users they don't like


## Add-on Features (if we get around to them):


App gives recommendations to users based on user supplied interests

Users can send pictures via messaging

Users interactions with each other generate "experience points" with each other, which unlocks features

Spot a stranger feature
 

## User Stories


“I want to meet people near me who share my interests.”

“I want to find events to attend with people who share that interest.”

  -Example: “Sometimes I need a gym buddy but feel uncomfortable walking up to random people.”
  
  -Example: “Sometimes I want to play basketball but I don’t know if anyone is willing to play.”
  
“I want a way to keep in touch with those people, if I like them, and a way to cut contact with them, if I don’t like them.”
